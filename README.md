# OpenSSA: Neurosymbolic Agentic AI for Industrial Problem-Solving

**Why OpenSSA?**  
OpenSSA is an open-source Neurosymbolic Agentic AI framework designed to solve complex, high-stakes problems in industries like semiconductors, manufacturing, and finance—where consistency, accuracy, and deterministic outcomes are essential.

At the core of OpenSSA is the **Domain-Aware Neurosymbolic Agent (DANA)** architecture, advancing AI from basic pattern-matching and information retrieval to true problem-solving. It overcomes the limitations of traditional **LLMs** and **RAG models** in high-precision, multi-step problem-solving tasks by combining **Hierarchical Task Plans (HTPs)** to structure complex tasks and the **Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODAR)** framework for reliable, real-time decision-making. By integrating domain-specific knowledge with neural and symbolic reasoning, OpenSSA consistently delivers accurate solutions for complex industrial challenges.

## Key Benefits of OpenSSA
- **Consistent Results**: Delivers repeatable, high-precision outcomes for complex tasks.
- **Advanced Problem-Solving**: Combines HTPs and OODAR for multi-step reasoning and real-time decision-making.
- **Scalable Expertise**: Leverages domain knowledge to scale AI without heavy data requirements.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Uses smaller, resource-efficient models, minimizing computational costs.
- **Extensible and Developer-Friendly**: Supports diverse LLM backends and is fully customizable for industry-specific needs.
