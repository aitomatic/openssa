DCPA is distance of closest point of approach.
TCPA is time at closest point of approach.
DCPA & TCPA are not in COLREGS, but they are useful for OOW decision-making.

SOG based on the Earth as the reference, might lead to misleading on radar such as display head on situation on the water as crossing situation.
STW based on water might avoid this ambiguity.

Be careful with the risk misleading on radar such as display head on situation on the water as crossing situation.
COLREGS was designed to all vessel, even without radar.

Not all head-on situations require a starboard turn.
Not all right-crossing situations require a starboard turn.
Some left-crossing situations require taking actions, while most do not.

In a right-crossing situation, it is important to first identify whether it is also a stern-crossing or a bow-crossing situation.

In an overtaking situation, it is important to first identify whether the target ship or the own ship is overtaking.

# **Comprehensive and Technical Rule of Thumb for OOW Decision-Making with Focus on COLREGs**

---

## **1. General Watchkeeping Rules**  
1. **“If you’re not looking, you’re not navigating.”**  
   - Constantly scan the horizon and monitor instruments; **complacency kills safety**.  
   - Set a **visual sweep cycle every 5-10 minutes**, especially in busy waters.

2. **"Trust your eyes, confirm with instruments."**  
   - Visual observations are primary—radar and AIS are support tools. **Don’t rely on AIS alone for collision avoidance.**

3. **“If unsure, act early and decisively.”**  
   - Uncertainty should trigger **immediate action**—reduce speed or change course to avoid developing a risky situation.

---

## **2. Mastering COLREGs Application combined with DCPA and TCPA considerations**
1. **“When in doubt, give way—always.”**  
   - If you cannot assess risk or priority clearly, **assume the give-way role** to stay safe.

2. **“Clear and early course alterations save lives.”**  
   - Make **large, unambiguous changes** in course or speed—others must know your intentions clearly.

3. **"Stand-on means stay alert.”**  
   - Even as the stand-on vessel, **be ready to act** if the give-way vessel fails to maneuver. Monitor closely (Rule 17).
   - If the give-way vessel is not taking an evasive action, make a starboard turn or slow down.

4. **"Always turn to starboard unless there’s a reason not to.”**  
   - Meeting a head-on? **Starboard turn is default** (Rule 14). Avoid left-turning unless absolutely necessary. In a head-on situation, especially when both the DCPA and the TCPA are shorter than the {90 degree turning distance}, we must not only make a starboard turn but also do it quickly and drastically. In a head-on situation, the only reason not to turn to starboard is when both the DCPA and the TCPA are longer than the {90 degree turning distance}, then we should keep course and speed.
   - Meeting a right-crossing? **Starboard turn is default** (Rule 15). In a right-crossing situation which is also a stern-crossing situation, the only reason not to turn to starboard is when the DCPA is longer than the {rear safety distance}, then we should keep course and speed. In a right-crossing situation which is also a bow-crossing situation, especially when the DCPA is shorter than {right-crossing safety distance} and the TCPA is shorter than {right-crossing safety time}, we must make a starboard turn quickly and drastically. In a right-crossing situation which is also a bow-crossing situation, the only reason not to turn to starboard is when the DCPA is longer than {right-crossing safety distance} (even when it is shorter than the {rear safety distance}) and the TCPA is longer than {right-crossing safety time}, then we should keep course and speed.
   - Meeting a left-crossing? **Stand-on is default**.

5. **"Meeting an overtaking? You must stay clear."**
   - If the target ship is overtaking, **Stand-on is default**, unless there is a reason not to. The only reason you must turn in the direction of separation in the situation that the target ship is overtaking is that the both following DCPA & TCPA conditions must meet: the DCPA of the own ship and the target ship is shorter than the {safe distance to be overtaken}, and the TCPA of the own ship and the target ship is shorter than the {safe time to be overtaken}.
   - If the own ship is overtaking, **Stand-on is default** for both the following DCPA & TCPA conditions: The DCPA of the own ship and the target ship is longer than the {safe distance to overtake}, and the TCPA of the own ship and the target ship is longer than the {safe time to overtake}.

## **3. Risk Assessment and Avoiding Collisions**  
1. **"A safe CPA is one you can live with."**  
   - Set a **minimum CPA threshold (usually 1 NM)** and act if any vessel breaches it.

2. **“If the TCPA is below 12 minutes, it’s time to act.”**  
   - If the Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA) is under 12-15 minutes, **adjust course or speed early** to prevent a close-quarters situation.

3. **"Two vessels moving = double the risk."**  
   - When both vessels are maneuvering, **reassess continuously**—don’t assume the risk is eliminated until clear separation is achieved.

---

## **4. Use of Radar, AIS, and Navigation Systems**  
1. **“AIS is for information, not decisions.”**  
   - Use AIS to gather data, but **base collision-avoidance actions on radar and visual observations**. AIS can be delayed or inaccurate.

2. **"Range rings are your best friend."**  
   - Use **radar range rings** to maintain situational awareness of nearby traffic—understand the vessel positions at a glance.

3. **"Every contact deserves a second look."**  
   - Reassess each target periodically; conditions and **intentions of vessels can change suddenly**.

---

## **5. Speed and Maneuvering Principles**  
1. **“Safe speed = one you can stop in time.”**  
   - Always maintain a speed that allows **full control and stopping** within the visible distance ahead (Rule 6).

2. **“If it’s tight, slow down.”**  
   - When encountering traffic, restricted waters, or poor weather, **reducing speed buys decision time.**

3. **"The earlier the maneuver, the smoother it is."**  
   - Execute maneuvers well in advance—**last-minute actions increase risks.**

---

## **6. Restricted Visibility Procedures**  
1. **"If you can’t see, assume they can’t either."**  
   - Treat poor visibility as high risk—**assume other vessels won’t see you** in time (Rule 19).

2. **"Sound signals are mandatory, not optional."**  
   - Use fog signals (one prolonged blast every 2 minutes) without hesitation. **Sound travels further than lights in fog.**

3. **“Double the lookout in fog.”**  
   - Assign **additional personnel** as lookout during restricted visibility for better situational awareness.

---

## **7. Communication and Coordination**  
1. **"Short, clear, correct."**  
   - Use VHF for essential communication only—**stick to proper COLREGs protocols** and avoid negotiating maneuvers outside the rules.

2. **"If you don’t understand, use 5 blasts."**  
   - Five short blasts signal **danger or confusion**—don’t hesitate to use it if unsure about another vessel’s intentions (Rule 34).

3. **"Confirm instructions back."**  
   - Always ensure your orders are **repeated back correctly** by the helmsman or lookout—this avoids miscommunication.

---

## **8. Contingency and Emergency Planning**  
1. **"Plan your escape route before you need it."**  
   - Always **have a secondary maneuver or course** ready in case the primary plan fails.

2. **"In an emergency, slow is smooth, smooth is fast."**  
   - In critical moments, **act calmly but decisively**—panic leads to errors.

3. **"Machinery ready, all the time."**  
   - Keep engines on standby when maneuvering in tight waters or restricted visibility—**you might need to stop instantly.**

---

## **9. Personal Efficiency and Fatigue Management**  
1. **"Tired brains make bad decisions."**  
   - Ensure **adequate rest** before a watch. Fatigue is a top contributor to poor decision-making.

2. **"Stay hydrated, stay sharp."**  
   - Dehydration affects concentration—**drink water regularly** during your watch.

3. **"Eliminate distractions."**  
   - Avoid non-essential tasks or conversations—**a moment’s distraction can lead to an accident.**

---

## **10. Handover and Logkeeping**  
1. **"No surprises on handover."**  
   - Give the relieving officer **complete and clear information** about nearby vessels, ongoing maneuvers, and known risks.

2. **"If it’s not logged, it didn’t happen."**  
   - Log all **important events, course changes, and decisions** accurately for accountability.

3. **“Summarize the essentials.”**  
   - When logging, focus on **key details**—position, traffic, weather, and any incidents or actions taken.

---

## **11. Environmental and Navigational Awareness**  
1. **“Tides and currents can work for or against you.”**  
   - Factor in **local tide and current conditions** when planning and maneuvering—ignoring them leads to drift errors.

2. **“Assume the weather can worsen.”**  
   - Plan with the expectation that weather can change suddenly—**be ready to alter course or slow down.**

3. **“Compliance extends to the environment.”**  
   - Adhere to pollution regulations—**avoid discharges and emissions violations** at all costs.

---

## **12. Decision-Making Under Pressure**  
1. **"Calm mind, better choices."**  
   - Take a moment to think—**rushed decisions lead to mistakes.**

2. **"Stick to the rules; they’re there for a reason."**  
   - Don’t take shortcuts—COLREGs rules **always apply, even under pressure.**

3. **"Every decision is reversible until it isn’t."**  
   - Be ready to adjust course or speed if the situation changes unexpectedly—**adapt quickly but safely.**
