  question: What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin
    is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain
    why.

  answer: "Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to:\
    \ \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs\
    \ litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related\

  category: 0-RETRIEVE

    the answer mentions at least 1 salient change among those discussed below:

    COST OF SALES:
    Cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year.
    Increases were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for significant litigation from additional commitments
    to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher raw materials and logistics costs,
    manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium
    and progress on restarting previously-idled operations, and investments in growth, productivity and sustainability.
    On a percent of sales basis, these increases were partially offset by increases in selling prices.

    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:
    SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year.
    SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant litigation primarily related to steps toward
    resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion,
    certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia,
    divestiture-related restructuring charges, and continued investment in key growth initiatives.
    These increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost management.

    RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES:
    R&D, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year.
    3M continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application development, product and manufacturing support,
    product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations.

    GAIN ON BUSINESS DIVESTITURES:
    In the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion ($2.7 billion after tax)
    related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen Corporation.

    GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE:
    As a result of 3M's commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing,
    3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit
    (within the Transportation and Electronics business).
