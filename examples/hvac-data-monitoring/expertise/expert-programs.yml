hvac-temperature-monitoring:
  task: |-
    Monitor HVAC temperature deviations and recommend inspection/maintenance actions if deviations exceed thresholds.

  sub-htps:
    - task: >-
        What are the recorded temperature values in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether the temperature deviates by more than 3°C from the setpoint for over 3 consecutive hours.
        If so, note down the time periods and the corresponding deviation values.

    - task: >-
        What are the last maintenance dates and the ages of critical system components (e.g., filters, fans, ducts)?

    - task: |-
        Adjust the sensitivity of the temperature deviation threshold:
        - For components less than 1 year old or maintained within the last 6 months, keep the threshold at 3°C.
        - For components over 3 years old or not maintained in over 1 year, increase the threshold to 4°C.

    - task: |-
        If deviations exceeding the adjusted thresholds are identified, report a Temperature Control Problem,
        and recommend the following maintenance actions:
        - Inspect and replace aging components.
        - Verify calibration of temperature sensors.
        - Perform a system audit for inefficiencies or leaks.


hvac-occupancy-sensor-monitoring:
  task: |-
    Monitor HVAC occupancy data and energy usage patterns to recommend adjustments or inspections if discrepancies are detected.

  sub-htps:
    - task: >-
        What are the occupancy readings and corresponding HVAC energy usage values in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether HVAC energy usage exceeds typical levels for low-occupancy periods by more than 20%.
        If so, note the time periods and energy discrepancies.

    - task: >-
        Check if the HVAC system is operating according to the programmed schedules and occupancy conditions.

    - task: |-
        Identify any sensor anomalies or misconfigurations that might cause false occupancy readings.

    - task: |-
        If discrepancies between occupancy and energy usage are found, recommend the following actions:
        - Adjust HVAC control schedules for efficiency.
        - Inspect and recalibrate occupancy sensors.
        - Investigate potential system leaks or inefficiencies.



hvac-co-co2-sensor-monitoring:
  task: |-
    Monitor CO and CO2 levels in indoor air and recommend actions if levels exceed safe thresholds.

  sub-htps:
    - task: >-
        What are the recorded CO and CO2 levels in the recent data?

    - task: |-
        Analyze whether CO levels exceed 9 ppm or CO2 levels exceed 1500 ppm for more than 3 consecutive hours.
        If so, note the time periods and recorded values.

    - task: |-
        Cross-check with ventilation system data to ensure proper air exchange rates are maintained.

    - task: |-
        Identify whether external factors (e.g., weather conditions, nearby combustion sources) might be contributing to the elevated levels.

    - task: |-
        If unsafe CO or CO2 levels are detected, recommend the following actions:
        - Increase ventilation rates immediately.
        - Inspect for leaks in HVAC or combustion systems.
        - Alert safety personnel and consider evacuation if CO levels remain elevated.
