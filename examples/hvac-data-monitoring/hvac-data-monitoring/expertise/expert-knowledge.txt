HVAC SENSOR MONITORING, MAINTENANCE & OPTIMIZATION
=================================================

Temperature Sensor Rule
-----------------------
HEURISTIC: If the temperature deviation from setpoints exceeds ±2°C for more than 1 hour during normal operation.

ACTION: Alert maintenance to verify HVAC calibration and check for issues in the heating or cooling systems that could be causing inefficiency or discomfort.

Humidity Sensor Rule
--------------------
HEURISTIC: If indoor humidity levels fall outside the range of 30-50% for more than 2 consecutive hours.

ACTION: Recommend inspection of humidifiers or dehumidifiers for proper operation and adjust settings or perform maintenance as needed to stabilize indoor air quality.

Pressure Sensor Rule
--------------------
HEURISTIC: If the pressure in any part of the HVAC system deviates from normal operational ranges by more than 15%.

ACTION: Check for leaks, blockages, or failing components such as compressors or valves and conduct necessary repairs or replacements.

Air Quality Sensor Rule
-----------------------
HEURISTIC: If CO2 levels exceed 1000 ppm or VOCs are consistently above threshold levels set by local health standards for more than 3 hours.

ACTION: Increase ventilation and inspect air purification systems for functionality; consider upgrading filtration systems if persistent high levels are detected.

Flow Sensor Rule
----------------
HEURISTIC: If airflow rates drop below 80% of the design specifications for more than 30 minutes.

ACTION: Investigate for duct blockages, filter clogging, or fan issues and rectify to restore proper air circulation.

Occupancy Sensor Rule
---------------------
HEURISTIC: If the energy usage does not correspond appropriately with occupancy data (e.g., high energy use with low occupancy).

ACTION: Adjust the HVAC control settings based on actual occupancy and check for sensor malfunctions or misconfigurations.

CO/CO2 Sensor Rule
------------------
HEURISTIC: If CO levels exceed 9 ppm or CO2 exceeds 1500 ppm in occupied spaces.

ACTION: Alert safety personnel, evacuate if necessary, and inspect HVAC systems and combustion appliances for possible leaks or inadequate ventilation.

Thermal Camera Rule
-------------------
HEURISTIC: If thermal imaging reveals hot spots or cold spots diverging from average room temperatures by more than 5°C.

ACTION: Inspect for insulation failures, window leaks, or system imbalances and address to enhance energy efficiency and comfort.

Vibration Sensor Rule
---------------------
HEURISTIC: If vibration levels increase by more than 50% from the baseline measurement of any mechanical component.

ACTION: Conduct a mechanical inspection to identify wear or damage in motors, bearings, or other moving parts, and replace or repair as necessary to prevent failure.

Refrigerant Leak Detector Rule
-------------------------------
HEURISTIC: If any increase in refrigerant presence is detected in the ambient environment outside of the 
containment systems.

ACTION: Perform a system check for leaks, repair any detected leaks, and recharge the system to ensure optimal performance and compliance with environmental regulations.
