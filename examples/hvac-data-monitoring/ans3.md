# CO and CO2 Data Analysis and Recommended Actions

To analyze the CO and CO2 data and identify any cleaning needs, we evaluate the recorded levels and determine if they exceed safe thresholds, which would indicate a need for action.


## CO Levels Analysis

- **Recorded CO Levels**: 5.0, 9.5, 10.0, 10.5, 10.0, and 9.5 ppm.
- **Key Observations**:
  - CO levels exceed the **9 ppm threshold** starting from the second measurement and continue through the fifth.
  - This indicates unsafe levels for more than **3 consecutive hours**.
- **Impact**:
  - According to HVAC sensor monitoring rules, CO levels exceeding 9 ppm require:
    - **Alerting safety personnel**.
    - **Inspecting HVAC systems** for possible leaks.
  - This suggests a need for **immediate inspection** and potential cleaning or repair of the HVAC system to address leaks or malfunctions.


## CO2 Levels Analysis

- **Recorded CO2 Levels**: 1450, 1500, 1550, 1600, 1550, and 1500 ppm.
- **Key Observations**:
  - CO2 levels exceed the **1500 ppm threshold** at the third and fourth measurements.
  - However, levels do not remain elevated for more than **3 consecutive hours**.
- **Impact**:
  - While immediate action is not required based on duration, reaching **1600 ppm** suggests that **ventilation rates** may need to be increased to prevent future exceedances.


## Cross-Checking with Ventilation System Data

- **Ventilation System Performance**:
  - Temperature readings are stable.
  - Occupancy levels remain constant.
  - This indicates that the system should be capable of maintaining adequate air exchange rates.
- **Key Concern**:
  - Elevated CO2 levels suggest that current ventilation may not be sufficient, and **adjustments to increase airflow** could be necessary.


## External Factors

- **Potential External Influences**:
  - Nearby combustion sources or adverse weather conditions could contribute to elevated CO and CO2 levels.
  - Investigating these factors may help identify additional cleaning or maintenance needs.


## Recommended Actions

1. **Increase Ventilation Rates**:
   - Immediately increase ventilation rates to dilute CO and CO2 concentrations.

2. **Inspect HVAC System**:
   - Conduct a thorough inspection for leaks or malfunctions, particularly in **combustion systems**, to address elevated CO levels.

3. **Alert Safety Personnel**:
   - Notify safety personnel and consider evacuation if CO levels remain elevated despite increased ventilation.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring CO and CO2 levels to assess the effectiveness of these measures and identify recurring issues.


## Conclusion

The analysis indicates a **need for immediate inspection** and potential cleaning of the HVAC system to address elevated CO levels. Additionally, **increasing ventilation rates** is recommended to manage CO2 levels and ensure a safe indoor environment.
