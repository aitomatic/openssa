Etching Silicon Dioxide (SiO2): typical recipe(s)
=================================================

If using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Reactive Ion Etching (RIE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------


GASES & FLOW RATES:

Common gas is CHF3, often mixed with small amount of Ar and/or O2:
- CHF3 provides fluorine for etching while also polymerising to provide sidewall protection, improving anisotropy
- Ar helps maintain stable plasma
- O2 enhances volatility of etch products

Typical starting point:
- 20-50 sccm of CHF3
- 5-10 sccm of Ar
- 2-5 sccm of O2


ICP POWER:

Higher ICP power (e.g., 500-1000W) increases plasma density and etch rate
BUT may also lead to more physical damage and less anisotropic profiles


RF POWER:

Lower RF power (e.g., 10-50W) provides more anisotropic profiles


PRESSURE:

Lower pressure (e.g., 5-20 mTorr) helps improve anisotropy


ETCH TIME:

You need to adjust etch time depending on desired depth and etch rate.

Remember that etch rate can vary across wafer and over time, so it's best to overestimate time and measure depth periodically.


END-POINT DETECTION:

Many RIE systems have optical emission spectroscopy (OES) or interferometry for end-point detection.
These can stop etching process when desired depth is reached.


OPTIMIZATION CONSIDERATIONS:

- Etch rate
- Selectivity to mask and underlying layers
- Etch profile (anisotropy)
- Uniformity
- Physical or chemical damage


SAFETY PROCEDURES:

- Always follow safety procedures when working with plasma etching systems and handling gases
- Confirm with facility and equipment manager that your planned recipe is compatible and won't cause any damage or contamination
