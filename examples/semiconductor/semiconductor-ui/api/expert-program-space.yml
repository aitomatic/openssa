  sub-htps:
    - task: |-
        Get typical gases used for such process and their flow rate ranges
        in SiO2 etching using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Reactive Ion Etching (RIE)
        
    - task: |-    
        Get typical ICP Power, RF Power and Pressure value ranges and associated trade-offs
        in SiO2 etching using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Reactive Ion Etching (RIE)

    - task: |-
        Recommend 2 parameter sets (each including Flow Rate for each Gas, plus ICP Power, RF Power and Pressure)
        with analysis of their relative pros and cons.
