          CHF3: 40 sccm
          Ar: 10 sccm
          O2: 3 sccm
      ICP Power:
          800 W
      RF Power: 
          30 W
      Pressure: 
          10 mTorr
      Etch Time: 
          Approximately 10 minutes (adjust based on actual etch rate and periodic depth measurements)
      Pros: 
          High Etch Rate: The higher ICP power and CHF3 flow rate will result in a faster etch rate, reducing overall process time.
          Good Anisotropy: The combination of CHF3 and O2 helps in achieving good anisotropic profiles, which is crucial for pattern fidelity.
      Cons:
          Potential for Physical Damage: Higher ICP power can lead to more physical damage to the PR mask and underlying layers.
          Less Control Over Uniformity: Faster etch rates can sometimes lead to less uniform etching across the wafer.`,

Gases & Flow Rates:
  CHF3: 30 sccm
  
  Ar: 5 sccm
            O2: 2 sccm
        ICP Power:
            600 W
        RF Power:
            20 W
        Pressure:
            15 mTorr
        Etch Time:
            Approximately 15 minutes (adjust based on actual etch rate and periodic depth measurements)
        Pros:
            High Anisotropy: Lower RF power and optimized gas flow rates help in achieving highly anisotropic etch profiles, which is beneficial for maintaining pattern dimensions.
            Reduced Physical Damage: Lower ICP power reduces the risk of physical damage to the PR mask and underlying layers.
        Cons:
            Slower Etch Rate: The etch rate will be slower compared to the high etch rate recipe, increasing the overall process time.
            Potential for Polymer Build-Up: Lower O2 flow rates might lead to polymer build-up, which could affect etch uniformity and profile.`,
  agent_advice: `#### Etch Rate and Uniformity: 
  Regularly measure the etch depth to ensure uniformity and to adjust the etch time as needed. The etch rate can vary across the wafer and over time.


  End-Point Detection: Utilize optical emission spectroscopy (OES) or interferometry if available on your system to accurately determine when the desired etch depth is reached.
        Safety Procedures: Always follow safety protocols when handling gases and operating the ICP-RIE system. Confirm with your facility and equipment manager that the chosen recipes are compatible with your system to avoid any damage or contamination.
