do I need heat treatment for the 316L with M 290?,"Yes, heat treatment is required for the 316L with M 290.","Yes, heat treatment is required for 316L when using the M 290 equipment."
Which steel can I print?,"You can print EOS CaseHardeningSteel 20MnCrZr9030-0004, EOS MaragingSteel MS19011-0016, EOS StainlessSteel 17-4PH9011-0041, EOS StainlessSteel 2549030-0007, EOS StainlessSteel 316L9011-0032, EOS StainlessSteel CX9011-0037, and EOS StainlessSteel PH19011-0019.","You can print with the following steels using the EOS M 290 system: EOS CaseHardeningSteel 20MnCrZr, EOS MaragingSteel MS1, EOS StainlessSteel 17-4PH, EOS StainlessSteel 254, EOS StainlessSteel 316L, EOS StainlessSteel CX, EOS StainlessSteel PH1, and EOS ToolSteel 1.2709."
can I print a part 50 cm long in the M 290?,"Yes, you can print a part 50 cm long in the M 290.","The conversation regarding the printing of a 50 cm long part using an EOS M 290 3D printer includes conflicting information. Initially, there was ambiguity since no specific details about the maximum build size of the EOS M 290 were provided. When the user asked whether a part 50 cm long could be printed, the response was that it is possible to print a part 50 cm long in the M 290. However, no specific dimensions were provided to support this claim.

In the discussion, there is a mention of researching the build size of the M 290 printer, which indicates that the appropriate next step would involve finding out the printer's build volume capabilities to accurately assess if a 50 cm long part is printable. However, the actual build volume specifications of the EOS M 290 are not detailed within the conversation.

Without the explicit dimensions of the printer's build volume, there are two contrasting statuses: one suggesting that printing a 50 cm part is possible, and the other, implied by the absence of hard data, suggesting that no conclusion can be drawn.

Given the conflicting information and the lack of detailed specifications, it is not possible to accurately determine if the EOS M 290 can print a part 50 cm long based solely on the information provided in the conversation. To resolve this, the exact build dimensions of the M 290 need to be consulted from an accurate source."
Is it preferable to use nitrogen when printing with titanium?,"Yes, it is preferable to use nitrogen when printing with titanium.","No, it is not preferable to use nitrogen when printing with titanium on the EOS M 290. Titanium powder and titanium condensate can react exothermically with nitrogen, presenting a fire and explosion hazard. The machine should only be operated with argon as the inert gas when using titanium powder."
